# AI-Based Patient No-Show Prediction System

## Problem Overview
Missed appointments in public healthcare cause delays, waste resources, and increase waiting times.
This AI solution predicts which patients are likely to miss appointments so clinics can take proactive action.

## Objective
Use Python-based machine learning to forecast no-shows and allow healthcare facilities to:
- Send reminders
- Reschedule appointments
- Improve resource planning

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- (Optional) SMOTE, XGBoost
##  Machine Learning
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Handle imbalance with SMOTE

##  Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle No Show Medical Appointments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
- Features: Age, gender, appointment day, SMS reminder, no-show history
